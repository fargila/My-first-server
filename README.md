# 🛠️ My First Backend Server

This is my very first backend project built using **Node.js**, **Express.js** and **REST Client** for testing. It features a simple API that handles basic data operations like retrieving, adding, and deleting nicknames. The server runs locally and serves both HTML pages and JSON data.

## 🚀 Features

- `GET /` — Homepage with a display of current data
- `GET /dashboard` — Simple dashboard page
- `GET /api/data` — Returns current nickname data as JSON
- `POST /api/data` — Adds new nicknames to the server
- `DELETE /api/data` — Removes the last nickname from the list
